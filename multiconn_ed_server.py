Multi-connection Server (Event Driven-like Server)

"""

"""
This is an example of a multi-connection server you can implement using 
the knowledge and guide offered here:
https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#multi-connection-client-and-server.

This multi-connection server can accept connections from multiple clients 
connecting to it via a socket. This is helpful, for example, when you are 
expecting your server to handle multiple concurrent connections without 
blocking new connections. This template will mostly follow the code 
offered in the site above, but will have a few more annotations in it.

The "event-driven" aspect of it refers to the fact, that in this simple 
model, the server takes action on when it receives a message, an "event",
from a client. This is in contrast to the "request-response" model, where 
the server waits for a client to send a request, and then responds to it. 
To implement the latter, you may consider how we can flip the use of 
"servers" and "clients" to facilitate such a model.
