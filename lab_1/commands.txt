ifconfig

inet 169.233.142.93

sudo raspi-config→enable SSH connection

on windows at cmd,
ssh akokuryo@ (wlan0 inet num)

change mode using
sudo cp /etc/network/wifi-interface interfaces
or sudo cp /etc/network/adhoc-interface interfaces

adhoc mode: is allowing the RaspberryPi to be the host of the internet. in this mode, it will not be having any internet connection(as it is having rn, though)
